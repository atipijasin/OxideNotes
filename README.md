# OxideNotes
OxideNotes aspires to be a free and open-source music visualization tool that renders MIDI files as "falling notes" with special effects. Built with Rust and Nannou for performance and visual appeal. This project aims to provide a high-quality alternative to commercial music visualization software. For now everything is still a big WIP ðŸš§
